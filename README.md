##Cataclysm 13 Pre-Alpha


##Terms of service

A friendly reminder to anyone who would like to create personal edition of a game to host a server while keeping the code base private - a source code is licensed under /tg/ Station 13 terms, and thus rendering your project closed-source will likely cause considerable sanctions on their behalf. Honestly, we tried it ourselves - it didn't work, and Byond administration officially disabled one of our servers for violation of licensing terms - don't repeat our mistakes.
